This document contains all changes made between codeKB releases that are 
worth mentioning.
There will be instructions if you want to upgrade below each release if there
are special things you have to do.



codeKB 0.2.002 (2006-08-21)
---------------------------

Added:

- MySQL support

- Drop down in page footer for faster navigation through categories

- German language file (help is still english only)

Changed:

- url now always contains &action=xyz for better cut and paste support

- in attachment/file view - added 'back to entry' link because if there is
  no trace below menu (after searching) there is no way to get back to entry
  
- bbcode urls will open in new window/tab when there is an http in the link

- in re/unlink entry view - categories can now be clicked

- in modify attachments view - files can now be clicked

- in forms - required fields will be marked with *

- code change - support more than just submit and cancel button

Fixed:

- in highlighting drop down the first entry was missing because of wrong loop

- in bbcode code listing there were two stripslashes breaking some listed code

- lots of small bugs


Upgrade instructions:

The config.php has two new and one changed settings - so you have to either 
replace or adjust it.
The first setting is needed - it's the database type setting telling codeKB 
what dbms you are using. ($conf['db']['type'])
The second is the bottom navigation - if this setting is missing there will be 
no navigation. ($conf['layout']['jumptonavigation'])
The third thing to change in config.php is the language file. Choose 
phrases_en.php for english or phrases_de.php for german.
