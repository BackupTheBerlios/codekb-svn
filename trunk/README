About codeKB
------------

What is it?
codeKB stands for 'source code knowledge base'. It was designed to keep all 
your patches, scripts, code snippets, short liners and algorithms together in
one place where you can find them easily.
Ever wanted to patch that new version of a package with the patch you wrote a
month ago - it is gone for sure ;)
Put them all in here and you can organize your code knowledge.

What is it not?
codeKB is not a tool like svn or cvs. It is not designed to keep whole 
projects or many code files that belong together. It don't has a revisioning 
system or anything like that. It's only for algorithms, patches and snippets. 
Go and use svn instead.

How does it work?
codeKB is a easy to use web application based on php. All of its content is 
stored in entries which can contain documentation of your source code and of 
course the code itself.
Entries are organized in categories to store them semantically. Because one 
code often suits to several categories entries can linked in different 
categories.
codeKB has a simple user management system with users and groups to define 
fine grained access rights for users on categories and the entries in there.


Development
-----------

codeKB was developed because there was a need for it.
This need is first of all a personal need and if this need is satisfied with
the current version of codeKB further work on the project will be done 
rarely.
If there are people out there that wish to really use codeKB for their own
stuff I'm willing to put more work into it trying to get more features and 
fewer bugs.
But I cannot garanty support for anything related to codeKB. I will help
when I'm able to.
Any contributions like language files or better looking layout templates are
more than welcome.


TODO
----

A quite incomplete todo list of things I remember I wanted to add to codeKB.

- making everything more userfriendly
- current fulltext search is still not what I wanted
- more bbcodes
- writing entries is more than uncomfortable. JavaScript or even AJAX??
- making everything faster. With lots of stuff in the db it could be slow
- more options for users - bookmarks and stuff?


Bugs
----

codeKB was tested only by me the developer - so there _will_ be lots of bugs, 
I'm sure.
However there _should_ be no crucial bugs that will kill your whole system.
But don't rely on codeKB as your only place to store your work until it was
tested by more than one user.
Please reportany misbehaviour you see - together with what excatly you've 
done and a backtrace if possible (debug = true).


Thanks
------

Because I'm using two external php classes in codeKB I want to thank these 
two projects: 
BBCode Parser

GeSHi - Generic Syntax Highlighter
http://qbnz.com/highlighter/
