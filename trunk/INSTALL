I Prerequisites
---------------

codeKB is a web based php application. Therefore you need a running web 
server with php. To store its data codeKB uses an sql database so you need a 
running sql server, too.
This document will not cover the installation of these prerequisites. You 
will find quite a lot of howtos for that.

What you need:

- web server (doesn't matter which one but codeKB will use htaccess and 
		      mod_rewrite in the future so apache will be best choice)

- php5 (because codeKB uses class constructs that won't work with php4 and 
        below)
        
- postgresql (codeKB uses some sql statements specialized on postgre. Maybe
			  there will be a mysql class sometime. Tested now with 
			  postgresql 8.0 but should work with 7.x, too)
			 
- fti.so (this is a fulltext search contrib module for postgresql and
		  _should_ be shipped with the standard package of your *nix 
		  distribution, so you should not have to worry about it)
		  
If you want to complain about the needs of codeKB feel free to do so.
Mysql support could be added when I have time for that.
I'm still searching for smarter fulltext search (for postgresql).


II Getting codeKB
-----------------

To get the latest version of codeKB go either to 
http://thiem-net.de/codeKB/
or to the berliOS project site at
?

You will find there a working snapshot like
codeKB-version.tgz

You can also use the berliOS svn repository for codeKB getting the latest
revisions of project files. But be aware that there is no garanty everything
is working all the time.


III Installing
--------------

In case you downloaded a snapshot of codeKB put the tgz file in a folder 
that is accessable through your web server and use the following command to 
unpack its content:

tar -xvzf codekb-version.tgz

where version is the version string of your file.

You will find a folder called data.
This folder will contain all files you are going to upload in codeKB. 
Therefore this folder must be writeable for the user running your web server.
If you are unsure how to do this use

chmod 777 ./data

to switch off all restrictions of this folder.
To get a bit more security this folder contains an .htaccess file for apache
which should prevent vistors of your site downloading the files directly.
But to be on the safe side you should move this folder outside the www
document tree of your web server so that nobody can access it from outside.
If you do so you have to change its path in the codeKB config file 
(more on that below)

To get codeKB running you need to import the sql scheme.
As there is only postgresql support at this time you have to 

- create a database for codeKB
	e.g. createdb codeKB

- connect to this database
	psql codeKB

- load the codeKB sql scheme
	\i scheme.sql

This will create all tables and a trigger for the fulltext search.
Remember that you need the the file fti.so in your postgresql contrib folder.

Again for a bit more security you should create a new database user which is
restricted to the codeKB databse. This user only needs USAGE rights on the 
tables.
Here you'll find information on postgresql's user management 
http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.0/interactive/user-manag.html
At the end of the scheme.sql file you will find to GRANT commands you can use 
to set the needed access rights.

After doing this you can delete or move the scheme.sql outside the www 
document tree.

Now you can use codeKB by pointing your browser to the www folder you put
codeKB in.


IV Configuring
--------------

codeKB should work with all its default settings but can change a few things
to fit your needs

Configuration of codeKB is done in the config.php file in the includes 
folder.

The settings are:

['general']['basepath']: This is the path to your codeKB folder. It can be 
					     set relative or absolute.

['general']['wwwpath']: This is the path on your web server. 
						http://domain.com/path/to/codekb
						
['general']['imagepath']: If you move the image folder you must change this
						  setting.
						  
['general']['language']: The name of the language file of codeKB. Currently
						 there is only support for english. Feel free to 
						 change the phrases.php file.
						 If you translate the whole file please send it to me
						 and I will add it to the package.
						 
['general']['rewrite']: URL rewriting using apache htaccess and mod_rewrite.
						This feature is not implemented yet!
						So this setting does nothing.
						
['general']['title']: This is the string that will appear in the browser 
 					  title bar and the codeKB site header.
 					  
['general']['stylesheet']: The name of the stylesheet containg most of the 
						   layout of codeKB.
						   
['db']['host']:	The postgresql database host - if empty unix sockets will be 
			    used.

['db']['port']: The port your sql server is listening.

['db']['name']: Name of the codeKB database you created.

['db']['user']: The user that should run all codeKB's queries.

['db']['pass']: And its password.

['access']['admin']: This array contains all codeKB users that are allowed to
					 modify users, groups and access rights.
					 If this array is empty - array() - every user, even 
					 anonymous ones will be able to do this.
					 Use this only if you're using codeKB locally without 
					 access from outside!
					 
['file']['path']: The path to codeKB's data folder. This should be outside 
				  the www document tree of your web server.
				  
['highlight']['path']: codeKB is using GeSHi to highlight code listings.
					   If you change the path of that class you have to ajust
					   this setting.
					   
['highlight']['linenumbers']: If true code listings	will be displayed with 
							  line numbers. If false there will be none.
							  
['highlight']['tab']: The number of whitespaces a tabular will be displayed
					  with.
					  
['highlight']['languages']: This array contains all languages the 
							highlighting is supported for. The array should 
							at least contain 'text' because codeKB is using 
							this as default.
							
['highlight']['binary']: Files marked as binary will not be displayed on 
						 screen. Instead there is an immediate download 
						 option. Set here the name for binary files.
						 
['bbcode']['path']: This contains the path to the bbcode parser used for 
					documentation in codeKB.
					
['err']['phperrors']: If you don't want php error messages appearing in 
					  codeKB set this to false.
					  
['err']['debug']: Setting this to true will display the execution time and 
				  the number of sql queries needed for a codeKB page in the
				  footer of codeKB.
				  Additionally if there are any errors a backtrace will be 
				  displayed.
				  
['layout']['showcounts']: This setting controls wether the category listing
						  will show the number of sub categories and entries
						  of each category. This may slow down things when 
						  having lots of categories.
						  
['layout']['showcountsrecursive']: The above setting just shows the number of
								   one level below the current.
								   Setting this setting to true will show the
								   total number of sub categories and entries
								   in the tree.
								   This will significantly slow down the page
								   when having lots of categories!
								   
['layout']['dateformat']: Set your date format here using a php format
						  string. (http://php.net/date)
						  
['layout']['entriesperpage']: How many entries should be displayed on one 
							  page before splitting up into several pages.
							  
['perf']['rightscache']: When having lots of categories you can set this 
					     setting to a higher number to increase performance.
					     This will cache the access rights (only per page
					     not per session! So it does not influence security)
					     to reduce the number of sql queries.
					     

So these a quite a few settings but most of them should be ok with their 
default value.


V Theming/Layout
----------------

Code and layout are explicitly seperated in codeKB. If you want to change the
layout of the site you can adjust the stylesheet (per default in codekb.css) 
or you can even change the whole html code.
To do so go to the templates folder (includes/templates) and have a look at 
the tpl files in there.
You will find $ckb[name] variables as a replacement of the later content as
well as some <if> clauses. There is no documentation on the templates yet, 
but they are easy to understand.
If you have a better layout for codeKB send it in and it will be added to 
the package.


VI Questions
------------

I'm quite happy when somebody wants to use codeKB - so if there are any 
questions on how to setup, use and work with codeKB I' always try to help.
If somebody has suggestions for the development on codeKB or found a bug just
send it to me.
